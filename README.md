# opengl33
Header file and Function setup for opengl 3.3

Really, Really ugly python script that processes the official opengl api spec and produces a header file and a file with a function that loads the extensions.

TODO:
* Make the python way less ugly.
* Add makefiles to build a static library
* Make the generated files more readable.
